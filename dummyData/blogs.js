        "description":"I was on the phone with my mentor, telling him how great I was feeling — that I had made it to the “other side” of a depressive episode that had lasted years and cost me a six-week stay in a psychiatric hospital.\nWhen I stopped chattering, my mentor said, “Be careful. Your depression could always come back.”       \nHe wasn’t being mean or trying to rain on my parade — he said it because it’s true, and he wants me to be wary.       \nI have major depressive disorder, along with generalized anxiety disorder, persistent depressive disorder, avoidant personality disorder and binge eating disorder. None of these are easy to treat, especially my depression.       \nUnderstanding Major Depressive Disorder\nI often find myself worrying about the likelihood of relapse. With major depressive disorder, I experience episodes, meaning I’m not depressed all the time. An episode is defined as a period of two weeks or more where you experience at least five symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, including a depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, sleep disturbance, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness and suicidal ideation. (However, this is not a comprehensive list).       \nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association, major depressive disorder is highly recurrent; symptoms return for at least 50% of those who recover from a first episode of depression. Approximately 80% of those with a history of two episodes will have another recurrence. One study found that, on average, individuals with a history of depression will have five to nine separate episodes in their lifetimes.       \nAddressing My Symptoms And My Fears\nI’ve already had at least two depressive episodes since I was formally diagnosed at 19 years old. I’d like to think I’ll be “ready” should an episode come my way, but I panic now even if I have a bad day.       \n“Do I need to call my psychiatrist?”\n“Maybe I should change my medications.”\n“I’m going to go on low battery mode.”       \nAnd so on.       \nI’m always walking a tight rope. Even though I feel great now — and have for months — I still have to be extremely careful. I need to get enough sleep — not too much or too little. I must take my pills at the same time, twice a day, every day, and keep up with the refills. I have to follow a healthy diet, drink tons of water and avoid any triggers, like violent or sad TV shows and books. I avoid napping during the day. I remain active. I don’t drink alcohol and try to steer clear of stressful situations. I stick to a daily routine and structure as much as I can. While these measures might seem like “normal,” responsible behavior, they are more than that — they are lifesaving. If I “break the rules,” I become emotional, impatient and irritable. I lose control of myself, and my thoughts go to a dark and negative place.       \nEmbracing The Journey\nThis is the major challenge of having several mental health conditions; sometimes, it can feel like negative thoughts are always waiting to slip through a crack and infiltrate your mind. At first, the thoughts and symptoms can be more subtle — I stop showering as much, then I take long naps during the day. I skip a day of brushing my teeth. But once my illness has me in its grip, it can be relentless and painful. I lose hope. I isolate. I give in to the darkness, losing my grip on the tight rope.       \nAnother challenge is battling shame and self-blame. Often, I wonder, “Shouldn’t I be stronger now? Didn’t I already crawl back from the pits of hell? I have grit. I have coping skills and an amazing support system.” But I have learned to ignore that little voice in my head telling me I “should be” better or that I’m unworthy.       \nIt has been a long journey. I’ve spent the past four years working on myself, and it’s been challenging. I’ve had bad days, even horrible ones, but I’ve kept going, and now I’m living my best life. I made that happen, with the help of my support group, therapist and medication.       \nAnd here I am now — voluntarily getting up at 5:00 am every morning. I take my kids to school and pick them up. I shower and brush my teeth daily. I have a column on mental health in the local newspaper, and I’m the communications manager for NAMI Greater Corpus Christi. I have found the right support, treatment and purpose.       \nI want to help others because I felt so alone in my journey, and it literally could’ve killed me. I want to lend my voice to those who can’t use theirs.       \nI understand that I have a mental illness, and that it’s never going away. That’s hard to accept, but even though the odds are stacked against me, I’m still betting on myself."

        "description":"In 2011, when I was diagnosed with major depressive order and generalized anxiety disorder during my first semester of college, I wasn’t exactly surprised. Mostly, I was relieved to have an explanation. The diagnoses felt like a validation of the sleepless nights, unexplainable chest pains, spiraling thoughts, crushing despair and constant exhaustion. There was a name for — and a reason why — someone with an objectively good life couldn’t manage to get out of bed and face reality every day.\nBut as I scanned the insurance paperwork (which was marked with specific numbers corresponding to diagnoses) and reviewed the slip of paper prescribing medication, I felt a lump in my throat. I wasn’t sure how to share this information with those closest to me. Would they see me differently? Would they say I was unstable? Or “crazy”? \nFriends and family had expressed concerns about my behavior in the past — the hyperventilating, the constant fear of the future, the days spent in bed — but having an actual name for this behavior felt so official. So clinical. How would I convince my friends, family, potential partners, teachers or future bosses that I was trustworthy? Or capable? Or normal?   \nTo Cope With My Discomfort, I Resorted To Cheap Humor\nTo manage my anxiety and depression, I began attending therapy sessions regularly and taking daily medication. These changes to my routine were lifesaving; my problems didn’t go away, but they suddenly felt manageable. I even developed specific coping mechanisms to address my panic attacks and depressive spirals. Still, despite the obvious improvement in my day-to-day life, I was embarrassed about the new label I’d been saddled with. My face flushed when my roommates caught me taking pills in the morning, and I found myself scanning the street outside my therapist’s office, terrified of seeing a familiar face. \nTo ease my own discomfort (and what I assumed to be the discomfort of others) I mocked myself mercilessly. By addressing the elephant in the room, I reasoned, I was protecting myself. Maybe a harsh word or an unsolicited opinion about my mental health would hurt less if I said it first. So, I made sure to call my daily medication “my crazy pills.” I consistently referred to myself as “emotionally unstable,” “chemically imbalanced” and, in the opening line of a dating app profile, “a hot mess of DSM terms.”   \nMy Attitude Only Made Things Worse\nThrowing around careless language, I quickly realized, did not make me feel better. My anxiety escalated as I tried to read people’s facial expressions and over-analyzed their reactions when I mentioned my mental health. The more I tried to eliminate the awkwardness, the more negative attention I drew to myself. And I certainly wasn’t putting anyone else at ease. Friends and strangers alike usually stared at the floor, unsure of how to respond, when I made a joke about my mental illness. \nMoreover, my toxic approach to addressing my own situation emboldened those who were not as well-intentioned to use similarly offensive terms. I was taken aback when a classmate referred to his partner as “certifiably insane” and winced when another joked about how her mother needed to be “committed to a psych ward” for her constant text messaging. But how could I expect them to speak carefully or respectfully when I consistently referred to myself as “a lunatic”?   \nI Decided To Change My Behavior And Normalize My Experience\nAfter several months of making jokes at my own expense (and, of course, unpacking this behavior in therapy), I realized that the stigma and judgment I feared was not coming from those around me — it was coming from me. My offensive quips to cut the tension only perpetuated negative stereotypes about mental illness. They also made otherwise normal conversations awkward and tense. So, I made a concerted effort to change my approach. \nI began talking openly about therapy with my friends, even sharing valuable insights my therapist had given me when it was appropriate. Eventually, I had offered so much advice that I became a resource to friends who needed strategies for managing stress. “Thank God for your therapist,” one friend joked. “She makes all of our lives better.” \nI also began referencing therapy in a casual way, much like how my friends talked about their various medical appointments. When comparing schedules to organize a group outing, we planned around Katy’s wrist MRI and my therapy appointment. Over time, my mental illness became a medical issue as mundane as any other. \nYears later, as the national conversation about mental health has continued to evolve, many of those friends have begun therapy themselves. And talking about our mental health now feels as comfortable as talking about what TV shows we’re watching. It’s one small part of who we are — and it carries no connotations of “craziness” or incompetence, like I once feared.   \nNow, I Find Ways To Speak Up\nWhile I am extraordinarily lucky to have a community that understands the reality of mental illness, that doesn’t mean that everyone I encounter has risen above the pervasive stigma. Sometimes, making progress requires having tough conversations. \nPerhaps the hardest part of combatting stigma is having difficult conversations with the people you see regularly. However, I’ve found that being gentle and honest is an effective way to start. I’m open about my mental health conditions and I’m happy to answer questions that people have. If I hear someone using the careless language I once used, I take the opportunity to share my lived experience.\nChange doesn’t happen overnight. But looking inward has been a great place to start."

        "description":"My first episode of psychosis arose from a brutal depression. A verse began playing in my head — from a voice that was male, angry and loud. I would later learn that this was The Voice of my psychosis, returning each time my symptoms did. He chanted in a deep timbre and his lyrics took on a mesmerizing rhythm.\n“You are the charmed one\nYou are evil incarnate\nYou will vanquish evil\nYou are invincible.” \nThis episode, and the series of psychotic episodes that followed, occurred in the 90s. However, it wasn’t until I started working with a psychiatrist, Dr. Lev, in 2005 that I disclosed my experience. When I began working with this doctor, I was in the midst of yet another episode of suicidal depression, and I endured six inpatient psychiatric admissions over 18 months. During this prolonged episode, the bouts of psychosis returned.\nI needed to know I could trust Dr. Lev — that she would believe me, and she wouldn’t laugh at what I was revealing. My fears are not uncommon; people with mental health conditions are often hesitant to let others know they are experiencing psychosis.\nAs my experience suggests, addressing this symptom can be a challenging and isolating experience. However, learning to trust my doctor and working with her to find the right treatment plan has been key to my recovery. \nPsychosis Left Me Feeling Ashamed And Scared\nI often revisit my experience by reading files from my hospitalizations. An excerpt from an admission note to an inpatient treatment facility in September 2005 read, “patient describes hearing messages coming to her from the radio, somber music playing and commentary voices.”\nWhen those of us who live with psychotic depression are experiencing delusions, we are often aware our thoughts are unreal, though there may be an element of doubt. This knowledge can feel terrifying as we wonder if we are gradually crossing the line from “sanity” to “insanity.”\nIn March of 2014, during one inpatient stay, a psychologist interviewing me inquired about psychosis, and I hesitated, falling silent and lowering my eyes. As I stared at the floor and played with my sleeve, I revealed to her that my room in the hospital was freezing, and I believed the maintenance men were following an unknown executive’s orders, purposefully blowing cold air through the vent up from the basement trying to freeze me out. \nMy Delusions Often Centered My Fear Of Abandonment\nEach spring, Dr. Lev took a vacation to Europe for three weeks. Whenever she left for these trips, my mental health would deteriorate, and my intense fear of abandonment emerged. Each time, I became convinced she would choose not to return.\nIn 2010, the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökul erupted, sending volcanic ash over nine kilometers into the sky. Europe experienced air travel chaos for almost one month. I became convinced that my desire to prevent my doctor from leaving was so strong, I’d caused the volcano in Iceland to erupt, preventing her from flying to Europe. Part of me knew I couldn’t possibly have triggered the volcano thousands of miles away. However, I feared that there was a fragment of my psyche that was conspiring against me. I could feel the gears grinding in the depths of my brain and The Voice rising to just under the surface taunting me:\n“It’s all your fault.\nYou know you wanted this to happen.\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself.\nYou’d better not tell.”\nEventually, I did confess my delusion to my doctor, and we explored the root cause of my fear of abandonment (and my enduring terror she would decide to permanently stay in Europe). In disclosing the delusion, I also feared The Voice would punish me for divulging our secret. I revealed to her if she didn’t return, I didn’t think I could survive without her.\nAdmitting how dependent I’d become on her made me feel as though I was a child begging a parent not to leave. However, she did not laugh or stop seeing me due to my attachment — she stuck with me and helped me find the medication regimen that kept The Voice at bay. \nI Have Found An Effective Treatment And Continue To Make Progress\nMy regimen of psychotropic medication includes two antidepressants and one of the second-generation antipsychotics. I take these on an ongoing basis, not waiting for an episode of psychotic depression to occur first. Dr. Lev and I feel that it’s critical to be proactive due to my history and genetic predisposition.\nIt’s been almost a decade since I’ve suffered a severe depressive episode with psychotic features — a decade since I’ve heard The Voice — for which I am thankful. I’m also acutely aware for a person with my history, there are no guarantees. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to how my psyche functions — and even though I worked hard in therapy to gain insight into self-sabotaging patterns and behaviors, there is so much we don’t know about the brain.\nThere are days I feel the ground is solid beneath my feet, and there are days I feel the soil shifting and it’s as though the ground might swallow me into a world of unreality. Staying right side-up requires working hard every day, listening to my doctor, using the insights I gained in therapy and trusting my brain won’t betray me. Because life is still more of an art than a science."

        "description":"It was November, just after I had been discharged from my fourth inpatient stay that year. I was depressed, anxious and unsure if I could finish out freshman year at my university. I had moved home so I could focus on recovery without the stress of living in an on-campus dorm.\nMy mom, desperate to find something to help me engage with the world, brought me to the local animal shelter. Immediately, I was overwhelmed by the number of animals with their faces pressed against the bars of the cages. My eyes fell on a young Siamese cat with a striped face and tail. She cowered at the back of the cage. A shelter volunteer told us that she had been there for six months, ever since she was found trapped in a wall as a kitten. \nI reached my hand into the cage. She tentatively rubbed her head against my hand before flinching and retreating to her hiding spot. The volunteer told me that she would need a lot of work if we were to adopt her, and she was unsure if the cat would ever come around to being a tame house cat. I signed the adoption papers a few minutes later and brought her home. Little did I know how impactful she would be on my recovery. \nA Reason To Get Up In The Morning\nThe new medication I was taking often sedated me, so I slept for most of the next few days. When I was awake, I spent most of my time bonding with my new cat, whom I named Maya. She stayed hidden underneath the bed I bought for her, never coming out to eat or drink. I brought out my favorite book, “Pride and Prejudice,” and began reading it out loud so she would get used to my voice.\nBy the second day after adopting Maya, she took a few steps toward me with trepidation. I held a treat in my hand and watched as she took it from my fingers. I took a few deep breaths, calming my anxiety that rushed through me. I had to be calm for Maya.\nAfter a few days of reading to Maya and feeding her out of my hand, she seemed to open up to me. She let me pet her, as long as I let her approach me first. Having an animal that I was responsible for gave me a reason to get up in the mornings. I had to clean her litter box, feed her and play with her. I couldn’t just retreat into my thoughts and refuse to interact with the world like my depression wanted me to. Maya needed me as much as I needed her. \nA Constant Companion\nAfter the week was over, I returned to my online classes for the first time since returning from the hospital. I did all my classes in my room with Maya, continuing to let her acclimate to my presence. One day during class, she climbed into my lap and settled down to sleep. I felt my first positive emotion in a long time that day. I even allowed a small smile to creep onto my face. \nMaya became popular in my online group therapy sessions where she would beg to play fetch by bringing me a toy mouse to throw as if she was showing off for a crowd. She started sleeping on my bed every night and would follow me around the house during the day.\nI started to see small improvements in my mental health after I adopted Maya. I had days where I was able to get out of bed and get dressed. Having an animal that was completely reliant on me calmed the intrusive suicidal thoughts I had been struggling with for the past year. Having a soft cat that was nearly always on my lap helped to soothe my anxious mind and gave me a companion to help me through my hardest days. \nA Source Of Unconditional Love\nI chose to withdraw from my university in the spring semester and take a couple months to focus on my recovery. The following months were difficult, as I underwent medication changes and treatments to focus on healing. Maya was by my side as I suffered through medication withdrawal and while I adjusted to the new medications. She was there when I came home exhausted from my daily transcranial magnetic stimulation sessions.\nAs spring turned into summer, I started seeing bigger improvements. I had more days where I was able to be myself and laugh, and I chose to interact with the world more. When my family went on vacation that summer, we brought Maya with us. I was able to enjoy myself for the first time in several years, and when I felt overwhelmed, I could always go to my room and find Maya, who would instantly climb onto my lap and settle in. Together, we could help each other.\nAt the end of the summer, I chose to enroll again in university. I felt that, with intensive support, I was ready to return to my education. Finding recovery took a good medication regimen, the right kind of therapy and an arsenal of coping skills, but in the end, it also took the unconditional love of a little Siamese cat named Maya."

        "description":"Up until four years ago, I was convinced that I would die by suicide. I made more than three serious suicide attempts that landed me in almost every emergency room or intensive care unit in Chicago.\nAt times, my depression was so severe that I could not walk, sleep or eat. I was fired from one job after another because I was only stable enough to work for a few months at a time. I prayed that I wouldn’t wake up in the morning, and then felt defeated when I’d open my eyes and hear birds singing. All I wanted to do was to escape from the reality of my life, so I often slept for 16 hours a day and actively self-harmed. \nLooking back, it’s painful to remember how sick I was. My depression created a pit in my soul that often took my breath away. I cried from one moment to the next, seeing despair and death in the most mundane or positive situations. \nFortunately, I survived, and I have moved forward and taken control of my mental health. I was able to do this largely because I was willing to ask for help and fortunate enough to receive it. The support from family and friends and expertise from mental health professionals kept me afloat even when I felt I was about to go under for the last time. \nMy survival is also due to several concrete steps that I hope to share with anyone else who may be struggling.   \nI Found A Role Model\nMy father was a recovering alcoholic, and after seeking help from Alcoholics Anonymous, he was able to stop drinking. His example of courage and recovery lingered with me even in my darkest hours. Because of him, I understood that asking for help was a courageous act.   \nI Accepted Treatment\nMore than once, I allowed myself to be admitted to the hospital. I also agreed to take medications prescribed by a psychiatrist — even when I did not believe medications could work (or, in some instances, when I did not want the medications to work). I even underwent Electro Convulsive Therapy, which seems to have made the most profound improvements in my symptoms.   \nI Managed My To-Do List When I Could\nOccasionally, the fog of my depression would lift; when this happened, I made sure the “business side” of my life was in order. I kept my doctor’s phone number within reach. I filed all necessary paperwork with my insurance company, and I filled all relevant prescriptions with my pharmacy. \nI got in contact with family and friends, letting them know that I appreciated their help, and notifying them of any important developments in my medical regimen. When I obtained an apartment of my own, I put my rent on an automatic payment schedule to cover myself in case I was sick at the time rent was due.  \nI Was Vocal About My Pain\nWhile my depression was painful and difficult to manage, I did not suffer in silence. I let people know that I was hurting even though I was afraid I would challenge their patience and unconditional love. This fear, I learned, was unfounded. \nFamily and friends came through for me: My husband cooked for me and accompanied me to all my doctor’s appointments. Friends and family called with encouraging words and visited me in the hospital. My in-laws wrote me letters of encouragement. People did not abandon me as I thought they might; on the contrary, the right people paid attention to my pleas and stuck by me. \nI Kept Moving Forward\nI feel no shame in having mental illness, and I am glad to be a survivor. I have met so many strong people, neighbors, friends and members of support groups who have created satisfying and productive lives with mental illness. I am proud to stand among them.\nSince my depression included psychotic delusions, I still have my struggles, but I have many more good days than bad. I continue to see a psychiatrist and a therapist who help me manage my medications and cope with my thoughts and everyday problems. \nI am grateful to organizations like NAMI that give me a safe space to explore my feelings and meet people who, like me, are survivors of mental illness."

    "description":"From the creation of the 911 system to the ways in which laws are enforced, policing in the U.S. is embedded in a long history of limiting Black communities mobility, self-determination and ability to redress and repair harm.\n In Atlanta, like in many communities across the country, the development of Community First Response was a step toward reckoning with this painful truth.\n For nearly a decade, I have worked alongside community organizers and servant leaders to develop a new approach to community safety and wellness in Atlanta as the Executive Director of the Policing Alternatives & Diversion Initiative (PAD). Following a two-year participatory planning effort, PAD has operated since 2017 to divert people from jail when police officers have detained them for activities related to unmet mental health needs, substance use or extreme poverty.\n Embracing Policing Alternatives\nIn response to transformational, Black-led, local and national organizing efforts, in 2021 PAD expanded to enable community members to request non-police response directly through our citys 3-1-1 line. Through partnership with the City of Atlanta Department of Customer Service, community members can call 3-1-1 to request in-person assistance for a range of concerns occurring in public spaces. These concerns include disturbances, public indecency and problematic substance use.\nUltimately, this kind of Community First Response directly improves safety and well-being by connecting people to appropriate care and resources.\nDeveloping Community Infrastructure\nHowever, simply changing the responder is not enough to change the current pattern. There is a long history of Black neighborhoods bearing the double burden of over-policing and under-investment in community resources that make places safe. This is a clear example of a punitive paradigm in which marginalized community members are under-resourced, then subject to intervention intended to achieve compliance and control.\nIf we are truly going to move away from a punitive framework, then we must go beyond investing in Community First Response — we need to also invest in community resources. By developing and increasing public accommodations, like bathrooms and showers, recovery communities that connect people to peer support and safe, accessible housing options, we reduce the need for any intervention altogether. By investing in this critical social infrastructure, we ensure that when an intervention does occur, it is a bridge to community-based solutions.\nListening To Lived Experience\nAs community-first responders, we have a responsibility to articulate the fundamental values that guide our work, and how they are a departure from a status quo that has failed our communities. The perspectives of people with lived experience of mental health conditions, substance use, incarceration and involuntary confinement must be our guide. At PAD, respect for the self-determination of the people we are working with is the golden rule of Community First Response. We trust the wisdom of our partners at the Georgia Mental Health Consumer Network and many others in the peer recovery movement who describe this as choice and voice.\nTo that end, we define Community First Response as consent-based outreach that seeks to increase the well-being and safety of the individual served and the community at large in the immediate and long-term. Community First Response provides a pathway to resources and supportive connections without any coercion. This definition can cause frustration for residents and policymakers who have come to expect that disruptive community members be removed or compelled to comply with an authority as the definition of success."

    description:'We all likely know someone with bipolar disorder — maybe intimately. But thanks to the stigma surrounding mental illness, we may not know that they have a mental health condition. Though estimates vary, about 1 in 38 people will be diagnosed with either bipolar I or II in their lifetimes — and maybe even as many as 1 in 22 people.\n Yet, despite the high prevalence, negative stereotypes about bipolar disorder are as common in our society as they are untrue — and revealing a bipolar disorder diagnosis can lead to very real discrimination; in the workplace, in opportunities, in civic/social participation and in health care. In fact, 4 out of 5 people find the experiences of stigma and discrimination related to mental illness to be more painful than mental illness itself. In part because of stigma, more than half of American adults with mental illness are not in treatment. \n The stereotypes people hold about bipolar disorder evoke extreme images of folks at their most unwell (or worse than that) — but do not describe people with well-treated bipolar disorder. People with well-managed bipolar disorder are able to be our most thoughtful, curious, creative and loving selves.\n Both of us, the authors of this blog, are living proof. We both have well-managed bipolar disorder. We identify as successful professionals; Sara is an entrepreneur and author, and Devika is a pediatrician and public health leader. We each have deep community bonds, including decades-long partnerships with our husbands, as well as loving relationships with our children, family members, friends and colleagues.\n<b>A More Complex Picture</b>\nWhile many people understand bipolar disorder to encompass wild highs — with delusions, visions and spending sprees — this actually only describes mania, which is part of bipolar I disorder, at one extreme end of what we now call the “bipolar spectrum.”\n People whose brains fall elsewhere on the bipolar spectrum — bipolar II and others — experience severe, life-threatening depression, but do not exhibit classic mania. Instead, we experience a milder elevated state called hypomania, with symptoms like anxiety, irritability, talking/thinking faster and an inflated sense of self, in addition to depression.\n <b>The Impact Of Stigma And Misinformation</b>\n On average, it takes over 11 years for people with bipolar II to get the correct diagnosis and treatments.'

I did not even have the vocabulary to communicate my mental health struggle to anyone. The word “depression” was not in my vocabulary. All I knew was that I felt like I was in a dark abyss that was threatening to swallow me whole.\nSo, I asked Google “How do I stop feeling miserable every day?” No matter how I phrased it, or what I typed in, the same results popped up:  \nMake sure you get eight hours of sleep\nExercise daily\nPractice gratitude\nEat nutritious meals\nSpend time with people you love\nEngage in activities you enjoy\nPractice self-care\nI was so frustrated with these results. Didn’t they understand that I could not possibly sleep eight hours each night? I spent most of the night crying until my sheets were soaked. Didn’t they understand that I lacked the energy to shower some days, let alone to exercise? Or cook myself a healthy, balanced meal? Didn’t they understand that I did not feel like socializing or seeing anyone at all? Didn’t they understand that I did not want to do any of my hobbies? Or that I could gratitude journal until the end of time, but it all felt meaningless?\nThe problem wasn’t that I didn’t have anything to be grateful for, it was that none of those things seemed to mean anything to me at that time. Everything felt empty, meaningless.    \nOnce I found the help that I needed, Google’s recommendations became very useful to me. But they were not my starting point by any means. I was in too deep of a hole to begin my healing with those things. Awareness is essential when it comes to addressing mental health challenges – identifying where you are can help determine what you need.   \nTaking The First Steps Toward Healing\nMy healing started with professional help; I began taking medication, which I’ve never talked about openly before. I had always been a huge supporter of breaking down the stigma surrounding mental health, yet I have never extended that courtesy to myself and my own journey. So, I hid the fact that I took medication for anxiety and depression.   \nI want to speak about it now because it was one of the best decisions of my life; medication truly saved my life. It lifted me high enough out of my dark hole so that I could identify what pieces of my life were no longer working for me. I was then able to leave a toxic workplace and exit an even more toxic relationship.   \nWith those changes to my life and with the help of therapy, I was able to start adding in the coping strategies that Google recommended to me. Movement. Healing foods. People I love. Self-care. Activities that bring me joy. With those additions, I was even able to wean off of my medication.   \nIdentifying Triggers, Red Flags And Coping Strategies\nI still have many things that trigger my anxiety and depression. When I allow too many of my triggers to pile up, I end up spiraling and finding myself back in my hole, even if only temporarily. Over time, I have learned what coping strategies work best for me. Things like yoga, journaling, taking long walks and attending regular therapy sessions have kept me grounded and healthy.   \nBut even more helpful than identifying my coping strategies was identifying exactly what triggers me and what my “red flags” are. For example, some of my triggers include dehydration, sleep deprivation, not enough fresh air, PMS, not enough alone time, not having a routine, being hungry and not moving my body.   \nSome “red flags” that let me know I’m being triggered are headaches, moodiness, irritability, spiraling thoughts, tiredness, a knot in my stomach, heaviness in my chest and overthinking simple decisions.  \nOf course, it’s impossible to avoid every trigger. But the key, for me, is to identify it as soon as possible when I am triggered — then, I can appropriately counter that with one of my soothing responses. This could include deep breathing, journaling, a hot shower, sipping a cup of tea, eating a snack, calling a friend, listening to a song — or whatever I have time for (and am realistically able to do) at that moment.   \nKeeping A List\nIf I could offer one helpful suggestion, it would be to make a list with three columns. In the first column, write down everything that triggers you. In the next column, write down what you notice in your thoughts, feelings and physical body when you are triggered — and label this “red flags.” In the third column, jot down what helps to soothe you in those moments."

    "information":"Mental health issues and real, traumatic experiences are pinned as a “normal part of growing up” or “just a phase.",
    "descriprion":"I was 10 years old when I decided my girlhood was over. Growing up — bullied for my size and isolated due to learning disabilities — my girlhood was one of privilege and a loving family; of itchy, sparkly dresses; obsession over whether my hair part was straight and drinking chocolate milk on the white couch with my little sister (and pinching my stomach afterwards to make sure it hadn’t changed). I loved being a girl but hated girlhood.\nSo, on that fateful day in 2013 when my iPod-touch screen lit up with Instagram-explore-page-graphics about “how to get abs in two minutes,” I decided I’d begin what I called a “health journey.” I would transform into a body that I wouldn’t associate with my girlhood. I made a promise to myself that I would do every exercise on every graphic that made its way onto social media, even if that meant working out all day. I’d try every diet that promised it would cure my fatness — which I was conditioned to believe was the underlying condition for my “symptoms” of bullying and self-loathing.   \nI looked in the mirror and decided I was a budding young woman who was finally taking control of her life — a woman who would no longer struggle to gasp for air in this all-consuming wave of sadness and loneliness. The shore of thinness and adulthood was so close that if I sank just a bit deeper, I could feel the sand tickle the soles of my tired feet. But I didn’t take the undertow into account. The more I tried to reach the shore, the harder I was pulled away into the ocean of sadness, loneliness, isolation, confusion and frustration over the fact that I was still deep in a helpless state of girlhood.   \n10 years and 13 eating-disorder-related hospitalizations later, I now know that I was not alone in that ocean. A recent CDC report highlighted in a PBS NewsHour episode concluded that “girls in the U.S. are engulfed in a growing wave of sadness, violence and trauma.” According to the research, 25% of girls experienced suicidal ideation, 14% experience sexual violence and 22% of queer teens have attempted suicide in the past year.   \nFolks’ reactions to those numbers, I’ve observed, seem to be something along the lines of “I am saddened but not shocked.” Why, as a nation where gender equality is far too often painted as something that has already been achieved, are we not shocked that girlhood and queer adolescence is riddled with suffering?   \nUnpacking The Invalidation Of Girls’ Experiences\nLooking back at the reactions from adults to my attempts to voice my struggles with mental health and self-esteem, my experience was often dismissed as “a normal part of growing up,” pushing a narrative that went something like “you’re a moody depressed teenage girl. You’re supposed to feel like this.” The normalization of teenage mental health struggles is justified by the cultural narrative of the “moody teenager,” what my Argentinean family calls “abhorrecencia” — which directly translates to “abhoresence,” a wordplay combining the words “abhorrent” and “adolescence.” For many members of my community, mental health issues and real, traumatic experiences are pinned as a “normal part of growing up” or “just a phase” until they become so serious that they require immediate intervention.   \nFor example, when I first came forward to teachers and trusted adults to share my experiences with bullying, I was told I was being dramatic— and that it’s perfectly normal and acceptable for kids to be mean. I was told that if I wanted more friends, I should be less judgmental about their behaviors and stop taking everything so personally. I came to internalize that I was not being bullied (even though I very clearly was) and that if I wanted my problems to go away, I just needed to stop being a “dramatic teen.”   \nWhile this cultural narrative of teenhood being an inherently difficult period being (and the root cause of youth mental health struggles and symptoms of trauma) may have been beneficial to validate teens’ emotions as a natural part of life, the report by the CDC is demonstrative of a tragically overlooked side-effect of this framework. Teenagers, especially teenage girls, are facing life-threatening mental health challenges that are being brushed off as simply being “hormonal teens.”   \nAddressing The Mental Health Impacts\nThe very real and tragic effects of this are that teenagers who have experienced sexual assault and struggle with depression and suicidal ideation may feel forced into silence because they have had their experiences minimized by this narrative. Or they believe the narrative themselves, thinking that they are supposed to feel overwhelming waves of sadness and that time and that adulthood heals all. I know I certainly belonged to this second category of teenagers, and it took me encounters with multisystem organ failure, a lot of trauma therapy and a whole lot of learning and un-learning to recognize that no, this is not simply “teenage girl hormones.” Because I was so used to hearing the voices of others telling me that I was sad because I was a teenage girl, those voices soon began to transform into my own. Even from my hospital bed, I felt that my disordered behaviors were a normal —and even healthy — reactions the conditions of teenhood, and that I was simply one of the unlucky ones who ended up in life-disrupting treatment because of them.   \nThe statistics in the article are not shocking because we all realize that being a teenager is hard. But now it is time to take that work a step forward and radically reframe how we view the difficulties teenagers face in America today. Adolescent mental health is a public health issue, not a “hormone issue.” And no, society is not going to just “grow out of it.”"

    "information":"Essentially I wanted to tell everyone the status of my recovery, because they were worried,” she said. “I just wanted to let them know I was ok.",
    "description":"After Madeline Stoiber returned home from a brief hospitalization due to a manic episode and bout of psychosis in January of 2022, she wanted to reconnect with friends, family and acquaintances — and she hoped to explain some of her behavior from the past three months.\n“Essentially I wanted to tell everyone the status of my recovery, because they were worried,” she said. “I just wanted to let them know I was ok.”   \nSo, in February, Stoiber began posting videos on Instagram. In her posts, she documented her reactions to her initial episode and subsequent hospitalization. Notably, she embraced the moments of humor and levity in her experience; she laughed recollecting how she believed she would become a pop star, and, in one video, shared “the weirdest things [she] did in psychosis,” including telling a couple she could talk to their dog (and the dog had a “really good life”). But she also addressed the pain, fear and shame that can accompany a traumatic mental health episode. Perhaps that’s why, months later, she has cultivated a strong following on both Instagram and TikTok, where her videos now receive hundreds of thousands of views and enthusiastic comments.   \nBy processing her experience with a social media audience, Stoiber is slowly finding her way back and changing the conversation surrounding serious mental illness.   \n“I was I was so unbelievably lost. I was so depressed,” she explained. “I was so horrified because I had to face the aftermath of two and half months of doing things that do not reflect me at all. My videos started as me trying to ‘get ahead of the narrative,’ but they became a chance to own my story.”   \nLouise Rumball, an entrepreneur originally from the UK, also began her journey on Instagram, sharing the highlight reel of her life — which she admits was “fake.” However, after beginning therapy and getting the mental health support she needed, she decided to pivot; she began posting about her real experience and started sharing the most helpful advice she received in therapy. Now, she offers (therapist-approved) tips in TikTok videos that rack up thousands of views — and she even hosts a podcast with her own therapist.   \nStoiber and Rumball are just two of many content creators who have taken to social media to share their experience with mental illness and treatment. Through confessional videos, whimsical TikTok trends and informative tips, they have harnessed the power of shortform video to explain their own experience, challenge the stigma surrounding mental illness and shed light on the realities of the mental health care system.   \nHere are some of their best practices when sharing your story online.   \nBe Open — But Protect Yourself And Others\nRumball notes that her social media impact — and engagement from her followers — really began when she started posting about her “real life” and challenges, from her sobriety journey to navigating family dynamics to dealing with toxic relationships. Her transparency, she believes, is the reason her content resonates with so many people.   \n“I started addressing topics that I never really knew how to talk about,” she said. “And I thought I was the only one. But once I realized that other people felt the same way, I decided that I could cultivate a space of openness, honesty and love.”   \nStoiber agrees that transparency is key — with some limits.   \n“I’m pretty much an open book,” she said. “But, of course, I make sure to protect the identities of other people involved and to be respectful of people’s privacy.”   \nProtecting yourself, Stoiber says, is also critical when sharing personal stories online. She has chosen to keep certain “very private” aspects of her journey to herself. Because, ultimately, while honesty and transparency matter, protecting your own peace is equally important.   \nFight Stigma\nAccurate representation of certain mental illnesses and symptoms, Stoiber points out, are missing from most forms of media. So, sharing one’s own story online is a unique opportunity to address misconceptions and put a friendly face to conditions that have been misrepresented, feared and shamed.   \nShe admits she was grappling with her own shame when she began posting videos, but her outlook changed quickly.   \n“The more I spoke about it, the more my own shame went away,” she said.    \nStoiber’s story also challenged the shame other people with mental health conditions were feeling. “I hear from people who have gone through the same thing, and they can barely speak about it. They don’t want to remember it,” she said. “But hearing my experience made them feel less alone.” Ultimately, she believes, calling out the stigma, judgment and resulting shame is the way to move forward.   \n“Speaking to the stigma ends the stigma,” she said.   \nDon’t Offer “Expert” Advice\nWhile a growing discussion in online spaces about mental health can be educational and transformative, content creators need to ensure they are sharing accurate information, and that they are not representing themselves as mental health professionals.   \nRumball is always careful to collaborate with the trained experts when she shares information with her audience. She does not want to encourage people to diagnose themselves and others without professional intervention — rather, she hopes to help people acknowledge their struggles and feel seen. \nWere all just made up of so many different parts that shape us in certain ways,” she explained. “I like to make sure I’m not guiding people to a diagnosis because that\\'s not my job.”   \nEmbrace Your Community\nWhile many creators like Stoiber don’t expect to reach a wide audience, they are given an opportunity to build a community of people needing support and camaraderie — thanks to the nature of social media and viral videos.   \n“It started with just people I knew. I had no intention of creating viral content,” she recalled. “But then I started getting comments from strangers and now I’ve made virtual connections with people who have had similar experiences. And I want to keep doing that.”"

    "descriprion":"In March 2020, I was employed as a special educator in a Connecticut preschool. When the nationwide lockdown began in the wake of COVID-19 surges, I counseled parents on Zoom, helping them understand how these dramatic, worldwide changes might be affecting their children. Employed — but at home, like everyone else — I waited for school to reopen in the summer. I was thrilled to return in July of 2020. Ah, life is back to normal, I thought. With masks.\nThen, in October 2020, the school’s director eliminated my position. Between the institution’s financial difficulties and safety issues surrounding COVID, moving from classroom to classroom was no longer feasible or safe. I was out. Unemployed. Shell-shocked.   \nMy Identity Disappeared With My Job\nIn January 2021, I began to experience severe anxiety, panic attacks and depression. My thinking became increasingly negative, and the future seemed bleak. At first, these feelings of hopelessness came on every few days. Then they became more frequent and harder to manage. At almost every turn, something would trigger my symptoms.   \nWhile I knew my despair likely came from these unprecedented circumstances and my unemployment, that knowledge wasn’t enough to mitigate my overwhelming fear. I had built my life and identity around being a “working woman” with multiple careers, each of which I embraced enthusiastically. I defined myself by my talents, credentials, dedication and success. I had become reliant on positive feedback from employers and co-workers, and I felt safe inside the working woman persona I had created.   \nIn fact, I’d say to anyone who’d listen, “I live to work. I will keep working until I’m dragged, kicking and screaming, into a nursing home.” I felt whole in the workplace. Back then, I didn’t understand that basing my entire sense of self on my work was a warning sign of trouble ahead.   \nAnd then unemployment rolled around and circumstances over which I had no control swept away the identity-bolstering construct I relied on to tell me who I am. I felt a catastrophic loss without work or anywhere to go. The obvious way out was to find a new job. But being over the age 65, I feared a return to the classroom, especially as the Delta variant of COVID-19 persisted.   \nMy mind felt increasingly unreliable as each day brought an ever-intensifying sense of disorientation. The days felt empty. More to the point, I felt empty. My life had changed dramatically. I could barely stand it.   \nGetting The Help I Needed\nIn March 2021, my therapist urged me to enroll in an intensive outpatient mental health program at Silver Hill Psychiatric Hospital, “as soon as possible.” Within a week, one of the hospital’s loving and empathic social workers assessed me. My insurance coverage was in place. I was ready to get help.   \nIn early April, I started a Zoom-based Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) program in which I spent three hours, three mornings a week, learning to better manage my disturbing emotions. Through distress tolerance techniques, I was able to come to terms with the radical change that had turned me upside down. I was so grateful to have a safety net like this to carry me forward. It felt like a miracle. And I had somewhere to be, nine hours a week!   \nFinding New Meaning And Direction\nAs I went through four months of group therapy, I became able to better evaluate how irrational many of my fears were. I began to see that I had to define myself separately from my work. This forced me to better articulate what made life meaningful — in terms of what I valued rather than what I did. Very gradually, the anxiety, panic attacks and depression decreased in intensity and frequency. But I knew that I would never again be the working woman I was before COVID. The trauma of corrosive doubt and the ever-present pandemic threat made it clear I had to find a new way to live.   \nBut the questions remained. How would I shape a new life that’s not at all what I envisioned? Who was I really, now that I’d been stripped of the workplace supports I’d studiously pursued for 50 years? As I participated in the outpatient program and dealt with reshaping my life in a way I could live with, I decided to find a way to work with children and families again.   \nToday, I facilitate an online parent support group focused on the concept of authoritative parenting. I coach a parent whose child was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. I volunteer as a religious education teacher for pre-K age kids at our Unitarian congregation. And I’m being trained to work with grieving children who have experienced loss. I also write a humor and inspiration blog— an endeavor that has become equally important to my work with children and families.   \nBeing A Stronger Self\nI can feel myself healing every day. My increasing ability to withstand ambiguity and change is a measure of my improved mental health. I’m beginning to understand that I can choose my attitude: acceptance of what is — flavored with purpose and optimism.   \nIt recently occurred to me that I may be stronger now than when I was working myself to the bone because I have my new sense of self to rely on. Work is not me; I am not work. I make new meaning, one day at a time, using my skills and experience to help others. To bring laughter to the world through my blog. To be a loving spouse and cat mother. A good neighbor, sister and friend.   \nWhen people ask if I’m retired, I answer with an emphatic “no!” I have more to give and more, much more, to create. I still struggle with anxiety, but the road ahead seems smoother. I’m grateful and hopeful. And I am out there in the world."
